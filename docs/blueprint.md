## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft Teal (#70d6c1) for a calming and health-focused feel.
- Background color: Light Teal (#e0f8f4) for a clean and accessible user interface.
- Accent color: Pale Orange (#fdb174) to draw attention to the most important actions, such as interaction checking and setting reminders.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for a readable and modern user experience.
- Use clean and accessible icons related to medication, food, and reminders. Icons should use a color from the primary color palette.
- Split the UI across multiple screens (Home, Dashboard), but logically group features into cards/sections within those screens.
- Use rounded buttons and cards to provide a soft and inviting feel, optimized for accessibility.
- Add subtle animations (e.g., fade-ins, slide-ups) when displaying interaction results or setting reminders.
